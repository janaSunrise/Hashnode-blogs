## Python Packages for better development

Python packages make life easier, and they're exceptionally awesome. Making development faster and easier, I love it! The packages are stored in their own repository called PyPI, aka Python package index.

And Python is totally open sourced language, licensed under their own license, and even all of the Libraries, which we Use daily, And almost Thousands of ew libraries are added to PYPI and Since python has been dominating in a Lot of Tech Domains, It has all types of libraries, which you expect. So, to start, I have divided the List into categories, so you can refer easily, and Find your Specialized Domains.

The Categories to be found here are:
- Graphical User Interface
- Web Developement
- AI and Machine Learning
- Data Science, and Analysis
- Game developement
- Automation and Scraping

So, Lets Start!

## Graphical User Interface

### Kivy

Kivy is a special Framework, aimed at making android development portable and easy from the perspective of java developers, and using Kivy, and Python is lot easier, than using java.

And moreover, It also makes android developement cross platform, since, using Kivy, you can access it from any OS, such as windows, and MacOS, and the Final App, is also independent, as it Can run anywhere, on androids, and iOS too.

It's the One and Only Best framework in Python designed to make Android developement, faster, and better!

### Tkinter

This is the default GUI, which comes with Python, when you install it, and Opt for this. It has a Default Tk GUI Toolkit, which supports rapid designing, and better outputs, when used properly, But **WARNING**: This Framework isnt suitable, when you're making or working on a Large scale Production application, as the Animations, and Styling Which really Looks great, cannot be achieved to a great Extent.

Here's an Example Code:
```
from tkinter import *

root = Tk()

# Creating a Label Widget
myLabel = Label(root, text="Hello World!")
# Shoving it onto the screen
myLabel.pack()


root.mainloop()
```

### PyQt5

This is a Tool, specially Built by the QT company, who provides The GUI for any language, which has the ability to run on various OS and platforms, independently, achieving Perfect Cross Platform Independence.

Here's an example hello world!
```
import sys
from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtWidgets
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow, QLabel, QGridLayout, QWidget
from PyQt5.QtCore import QSize    

class HelloWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        QMainWindow.__init__(self)

        self.setMinimumSize(QSize(640, 480))    
        self.setWindowTitle("Hello world") 

        centralWidget = QWidget(self)          
        self.setCentralWidget(centralWidget)   

        gridLayout = QGridLayout(self)     
        centralWidget.setLayout(gridLayout)  

        title = QLabel("Hello World from PyQt", self) 
        title.setAlignment(QtCore.Qt.AlignCenter) 
        gridLayout.addWidget(title, 0, 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    mainWin = HelloWindow()
    mainWin.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

### PySide

There is an application / user interface (UI) framework written in C++ language called Qt (cute). Pyside is a wrapper of QT.

The difference with PySide is that PyQt is commercially available. And PySide, is good at Performace, but not at styling.

### PyGui

PyGUI targets Unix, Macintosh, and Windows platforms.
The focus of this MVC framework is to fit into the Python ecosystem with as much ease as possible.
And this is Not Great too for large scale applicationas, but relatively, easy to use and get started!

### Web Developement

### Django

As per the Django's Official Definition, it's The only Large scale web developement framework, that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. And It also Provides the basic tools, and Code, along with it's Own API, that Holds the tools, you frequently need to implement the features in a simple and robust manner.

Why is Django So popular:
- User Friendly
- Best to use when making quite large web apps
- Provides a neat set of tools, that speeds up developement
- Moderate to learn, easy to use

### Flask

Flask is a web development framework developed in Python. It is easy to learn and use. Flask is "beginner-friendly" because it does not have boilerplate code or dependencies, which can distract from the primary function of an application.

Some features which make Flask an ideal framework for web application development are:

- Flask provides a development server and a debugger.
- It uses Jinja2 templates.
- It is compliant with WSGI 1.0.
- It provides integrated support for unit testing.
- Many extensions are available for Flask, which can be used to enhance its functionalities.

Here's a simple hello world in Flask:
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Tornado

Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, Which also provides the feature of Unblocking connections to the website, the program and the framework, handling every user Asynchronously. By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.

Here's a Simple Hello world in Tornado:
```
import tornado.ioloop
import tornado.web

class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        self.write("Hello, world")

def make_app():
    return tornado.web.Application([
        (r"/", MainHandler),
    ])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = make_app()
    app.listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()
```

## Automation and Scraping

### Requests

Requests is a Library that's made with the motto of **"HTTP For Humans"** which enables people, to interact with the web, and apis consisting of HTTP, in an easy way, which can be understood by us, and even how the HTTP works.

It enables us to do things, that we're not able to do Manually, Like
- Sending Headers
- Sending Post Requests
- Sending authentication key for authorization

Here's an Example of scraping an API:
```
import requests

req = requests.get("https://mrwinson.me/api/jokes/random")

# Extract json
data = req.json()

# Get the joke
joke = data["joke"]

print(joke)
```

### Beautiful Soup 4

This library comes in handy, When you can't use an API for a website's endpoint, r it doesn't exist, then Beautiful Soup helps to analyze the Website, and Find the required data in the html page. And Moreover, it also supports pulling the contents from XML files too with the new update.

And in brief, Web scraping is a useful method that is used to extract useful data of a website by extracting the HTML of the website when You can't use JSON APIs.

## Some extra tidbits!

### What are Microframeworks?

Micro-frameworks are the opposite of full-stack frameworks, which also offer additional modules for features such as authentication, database ORM, input validation and sanitization, etc.

####Why is CherryPy and Flask considered Microframework?

Flask and CherryPy are known as a micro-frameworks because they are lightweight and only provides components that are essential. It only provides the necessary components for web development, such as routing, request handling, sessions, and so on. For the other functionalities such as data handling, the developer can write a custom module or use an extension. This approach avoids unnecessary boilerplate code, which is not even being used.
